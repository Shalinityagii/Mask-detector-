<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>

<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</h4>
</div>


## Working
* p5.js for making it on the web and use TensorFlow js (ml5.js) to classify.
* Here I have used my own images for model training and using transfer learning I was able to classify the things.


## Results
Low maintance light model for survillance purposes. This is a prototype just to show how gate keeping using survillance of masks can be done with ease.

### Further Enhancements 
 To develope a project which is a door lock system, which opens only when the camera detects that user is wearing a mask.
